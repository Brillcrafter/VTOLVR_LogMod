# VTOLVR Pilot Log Mod

This mod will keep track of your; A2A, A2G, Ship kills, Your Number of Takeoffs and Landings, Your Number of Ejections and Deaths, and your successful and failed missions count.

It will only work in singlePlayer missions, I may add multiplayer compatability but that depends on on how reliably the game logs your kills clienside.

If you have any questions or advice, You can find me in the VTOLVR Modding discord with the name Brillcrafter.
